## Configuring mailto:

When you select **Email link handler (mailto:)** in Page Mail’s options, the extension uses your browser’s configured handler for `mailto:` links. This can be your operating system’s default email app or a webmail service (like Gmail or Outlook.com).

To choose or change which program or service your browser uses for email links:

- See the help article: [How do I change my web browser's default email client for mailto links?](https://support.procore.com/faq/how-do-i-change-my-web-browsers-default-email-client-for-mailto-links)

This article explains how to:
- Set your preferred desktop email client (such as Thunderbird®, Outlook®, or Apple Mail®)
- Use a web mail service (such as Gmail) for mailto links
- Change these settings on Windows®, macOS®, or Linux®

## FAQ

**Q: Why doesn’t Page Mail work on some pages (e.g., about:, chrome:, edge:)?**  
A: Extensions are restricted from accessing certain protected pages for security reasons. If you try to use Page Mail on these pages, you’ll see a popup explaining the limitation.

**Q: Can I use a different keyboard shortcut?**  
A: Yes! Use your browser's extension manager to set your preferred shortcut for Page Mail.

**Q: What if my email doesn’t include selected text?**  
A: Only text you’ve actively selected on the page will be included. If nothing is selected, only the URL is included.
