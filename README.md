## CONFIGURING MAILTO:

When you select **Email link handler (mailto:)** in Page Mail’s options, the extension uses Firefox’s configured handler for `mailto:` links. This can be your operating system’s default email app or a webmail service (like Gmail or Outlook.com).

To choose or change which program or service Firefox uses for email links:

- See the Mozilla help article: [Change the program used to open email links](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/change-program-used-open-email-links)

This article explains how to:
- Set your preferred desktop email client (such as Thunderbird, Outlook, or Apple Mail)
- Use a webmail service (such as Gmail) for mailto links
- Change these settings on Windows, macOS, or Linux

## FAQ

**Q: Why doesn’t Page Mail work on some pages (like `about:`, `addons.mozilla.org`, or other internal pages)?**  
A: Firefox restricts extensions from running on certain protected pages for security reasons. If you try to use Page Mail on these pages, you’ll see a popup explaining the limitation.

**Q: Can I use a different keyboard shortcut?**  
A: Yes! Go to `about:addons`, click the gear icon, choose “Manage Extension Shortcuts,” and set your preferred shortcut for Page Mail.

**Q: What if my email doesn’t include selected text?**  
A: Only text you’ve actively selected on the page will be included. If nothing is selected, only the URL is sent.

## Known Issues

- Page Mail cannot work on Firefox internal pages (e.g., `about:`, `addons.mozilla.org`) due to browser security restrictions.
- Some webmail services may require you to be logged in before composing a message.
- The mailto: handler uses your Firefox settings; see [Configuring Mailto](#configuring-mailto) above.
